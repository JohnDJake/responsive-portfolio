# Responsive Portfolio (Homework-02): John Jacobson

## Description

This is a portfolio website created with a responsive layout using Bootstrap. The home page has a brief description of my professional experience, as well as links to my Github and Linkedin profiles. The portfolio page has a responsive grid with placeholder images, and the contact page has a placeholder form.

In creating this project I learned the general usage for responsive layouts with Bootstrap.

[Deployed here on Github Pages](https://johndjake.github.io/responsive-portfolio/).


## Usage

Navigate the site using the navbar at the top of the page.
